- **Automated Workflow**: AWS-powered backend for seamless automation and scalability.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: React-based frontend divided into Home, Feature, Roadmap, and About Us sections.

## Technologies Used

### React Components
- **Description**: React components form the backbone of our user interface, ensuring reusability and efficiency.
- **Usage**: We used React components to create a dynamic and responsive user interface for HelmetWatch.

### AWS Services
- **Description**: AWS provides a comprehensive suite of cloud services for automated workflows, storage, and computing power.
- **Usage**: AWS services are utilized to manage the backend operations of HelmetWatch, ensuring scalability and reliability.

### Deep Learning Models
- **Description**: Advanced deep learning models are employed to detect helmet usage with high accuracy.
- **Usage**: These models process images and videos to identify whether individuals are wearing helmets.

## Deep Learning Architecture

### MobileNetV2 Backbone
- **Description**: MobileNetV2 is a lightweight deep learning model designed for mobile and edge devices.
- **Usage**: It serves as the backbone network, providing feature extraction capabilities while maintaining high efficiency and speed.

### Feature Pyramid Network (FPN)
- **Description**: FPN is a feature extractor that builds a multi-scale feature pyramid for object detection tasks.
- **Usage**: It enhances the model's ability to detect objects at different scales, improving accuracy in helmet detection.

### Region Proposal Network (RPN)
- **Description**: RPN is used to propose candidate object regions in an image.
- **Usage**: It generates region proposals that are likely to contain objects, streamlining the detection process.

### ROI Align
- **Description**: ROI Align is a technique for extracting precise feature maps from regions of interest.
- **Usage**: It ensures accurate alignment of the features, leading to better object detection performance.

### Fast R-CNN
- **Description**: Fast R-CNN is a deep learning model for object detection that combines RPN and ROI Align for faster processing.
- **Usage**: It refines the proposals and classifies them into different categories, such as "helmet" or "no helmet".
